Sensible structure, questionable features, 1000% efficiency.

## Notes:

- Cyrillics are supported (kind of). There are some limitations, but I can't do anything with them due to keyboard layout and the way Vim handles input. If you figure something out, let me know!
- Currently I'm on Windows, so Linux/MacOS/... users may need to change a couple of lines to support their system.
- I use [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh), so tools which rely on POSIX-compliance may break.
- A couple of packages require external tooling, others may need hacky workarounds. If something doesn't work out of the box, feel free to change it to your taste or open an issue. I recommend starting with a quick check of the package's repo.
- I've tried to document all config decisions that might look a bit strange, and hopefully covered everything. If not, feel free to ask!
- From time to time, when a package breaks, I tend to come up with a dirty fix right in its source directory instead of waiting for an update. So, don't be surprised if something works for me and not for you. Message me and I'll try to help you out!
